Sensing In Motion
===============

Environmental awareness is a big topic these days and more and more DIY projects involving environmental sensing are appearing.

“Sensing In Motion” is a project developed by Marco Rodrigues and Miguel Sandim from Portugal.

The goal is to make an environmental sensing structure/station that reads several parameters and sends them to a remote server.
This station can also be plugged on any vehicle (during the course of this project we chose a quadcopter).

## Hardware involved
### Sensing module
* **Processing unit:** Arduino Uno R3
* **Communication module:** Arduino GSM/GPRS Shield

##### Sensors modules
